Description: LXC userspace filesystem
 LXCFS is a simple userspace filesystem designed to workaround some current
 limitations of the Linux kernel. The main driver for this work was the
 need to run systemd based containers as a regular unprivileged user
 while still allowing systemd inside the container to interact with cgroups.
