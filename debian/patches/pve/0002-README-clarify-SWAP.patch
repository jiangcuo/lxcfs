+## Swap handling
+If you noticed LXCFS not showing any SWAP in your container despite
+having SWAP on your system, please read this section carefully and look
+for instructions on how to enable SWAP accounting for your distribution.
+
+Swap cgroup handling on Linux is very confusing and there just isn't a
+perfect way for LXCFS to handle it.
+
+Terminology used below:
+ - RAM refers to `memory.usage_in_bytes` and `memory.limit_in_bytes`
+ - RAM+SWAP refers to `memory.memsw.usage_in_bytes` and `memory.memsw.limit_in_bytes`
+
+The main issues are:
+ - SWAP accounting is often opt-in and, requiring a special kernel boot
+   time option (`swapaccount=1`) and/or special kernel build options
+   (`CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP`).
+
+ - Both a RAM limit and a RAM+SWAP limit can be set. The delta however
+   isn't the available SWAP space as the kernel is still free to SWAP as
+   much of the RAM as it feels like. This makes it impossible to render
+   a SWAP device size as using the delta between RAM and RAM+SWAP for that
+   wouldn't account for the kernel swapping more pages, leading to swap
+   usage exceeding swap total.
+
+ - It's impossible to disable SWAP in a given container. The closest
+   that can be done is setting swappiness down to 0 which severly limits
+   the risk of swapping pages but doesn't eliminate it.
+
+As a result, LXCFS had to make some compromise which go as follow:
+ - When SWAP accounting isn't enabled, no SWAP space is reported at all.
+   This is simply because there is no way to know the SWAP consumption.
+   The container may very much be using some SWAP though, there's just
+   no way to know how much of it and showing a SWAP device would require
+   some kind of SWAP usage to be reported. Showing the host value would be
+   completely wrong, showing a 0 value would be equallty wrong.
+
+ - Because SWAP usage for a given container can exceed the delta between
+   RAM and RAM+SWAP, the SWAP size is always reported to be the smaller of
+   the RAM+SWAP limit or the host SWAP device itself. This ensures that at no
+   point SWAP usage will be allowed to exceed the SWAP size.
+
+ - If the swappiness is set to 0 and there is no SWAP usage, no SWAP is reported.
+   However if there is SWAP usage, then a SWAP device of the size of the
+   usage (100% full) is reported. This provides adequate reporting of
+   the memory consumption while preventing applications from assuming more
+   SWAP is available.
